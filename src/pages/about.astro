        <h2>Built by Immigrants, For Immigrants</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to <strong>BC PNP Calculator</strong>, your dedicated resource for navigating the British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program (BC PNP).
        </p>
        <p>
          This platform was born from personal experience—the frustration, confusion, and sleepless nights that come with navigating Canada's immigration system. We know what it's like to refresh government websites at midnight, desperately trying to understand if your profile is competitive enough. We've felt the anxiety of not knowing whether you're one point away from an invitation or hopelessly far behind.
        </p>

        <h2>The Founder's Story</h2>
        <p>
          BC PNP Calculator was created by someone who walked the same path you're on right now. After years of working in Canada on a work permit, struggling to understand the intricate point calculations and wondering if permanent residence was even achievable, our founder decided enough was enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          The turning point came during a family gathering in 2024. Watching friends and relatives navigate the same confusing BC PNP documentation—with some paying hundreds of dollars for simple score calculations—made it clear that there had to be a better way. The official government calculators were either outdated, confusing, or nonexistent. Paid services were expensive and often provided estimates that could easily be calculated with the right tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          That night, the first prototype of this calculator was built. What started as a simple spreadsheet evolved into a comprehensive web tool that has now helped <strong>thousands of aspiring permanent residents</strong> understand their immigration prospects.
        </p>

        <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
        <p>
          Immigration is already stressful enough. You shouldn't have to pay for basic information or waste hours trying to decode government policy documents. Here's what drove us to create this platform:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Immigration consultants charge $200-500 just for a score assessment. We believe this information should be free and accessible to everyone.</li>
          <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Many online calculators are outdated or don't reflect the latest SIRS criteria. We stay on top of every policy change.</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Your immigration profile is deeply personal. Unlike other tools that store your data on servers, our calculator runs <strong>entirely in your browser</strong>. We never see, store, or transmit your information.</li>
          <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Understanding your score is the first step to immigration success. We want to give you the knowledge to make informed decisions about your future.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is simple: <strong>democratize access to immigration information</strong>. Every prospective immigrant deserves to know where they stand without paying expensive fees or navigating government bureaucracy alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          We provide free, accurate, and easy-to-use tools that help prospective immigrants understand their eligibility and potential scores under the Skills Immigration Registration System (SIRS). We believe that access to information should be free, transparent, and privacy-respecting.
        </p>
