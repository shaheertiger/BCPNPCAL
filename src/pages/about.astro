        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to <strong>BC PNP Calculator</strong>, your dedicated resource for navigating the British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program (BC PNP).
        </p>
        <p>
          Immigration processes can be complex, overwhelming, and filled with uncertainty. Our mission is to simplify this journey by providing <strong>free, accurate, and easy-to-use tools</strong> that help prospective immigrants understand their eligibility and potential scores under the Skills Immigration Registration System (SIRS).
        </p>

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          We are a team of technology enthusiasts and immigration advocates who believe that access to information should be free and transparent. Having navigated various immigration systems ourselves, we understand the anxiety that comes with calculating points and waiting for invitations.
        </p>
        <p>
            We created this platform to bridge the gap between complex government policy documents and the practical needs of applicants.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Offer</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Instant Score Calculation:</strong> Our calculator is constantly updated to reflect the latest BC PNP scoring criteria.</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy First:</strong> We believe your data belongs to you. Our calculator runs entirely in your browser—we do not store or transmit your personal profile data.</li>
          <li><strong>Educational Guides:</strong> We provide detailed breakdowns of scoring sections, processing times, and draw history to keep you informed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Transparency & Disclaimer</h2>
