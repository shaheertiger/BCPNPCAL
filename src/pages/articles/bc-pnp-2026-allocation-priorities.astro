                <p>
                    Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has
                    allocated <strong>5,254 provincial nominations</strong> to British
                    Columbia for the 2026 calendar year. This is a significant development
                    that will shape immigration to BC for the entire year.
                </p>

                    > for 2026 to meet its labor market needs. The federal government
                    allocated only 58% of that request.

                <h2>What This Means for Applicants</h2>

                <h3>1. Higher Competition Expected</h3>
                <p>
                    With fewer nominations than BC used in 2025, competition
                    will likely be <strong>more intense</strong>. This means:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Higher cut-off scores in BC PNP draws</li>
                    <li>Fewer invitations per draw</li>
                    <li>Longer wait times in the SIRS pool</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Priority Sectors Will Dominate</h3>
                <p>
                    BC PNP has indicated it will focus on candidates who can <strong
                        >immediately contribute to the workforce</strong
                    >. This likely means continued priority for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tech Pilot occupations</strong> – Software developers,
                        data analysts, IT professionals
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Healthcare workers</strong> – Nurses, medical technicians,
                        care aides
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Skilled trades</strong> – Electricians, plumbers,
                        construction workers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Childcare professionals</strong> – ECE workers in
                        high demand
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Student Streams Remain Suspended</h3>
                <p>
                    The new Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctorate student streams
                    that were planned for January 2025 remain <strong
                        >indefinitely suspended</strong
                    >. BC has stated these will not launch until allocation
                    levels are restored to adequate levels.
                </p>

                        points bonuses.

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>Will BC get more nominations later in 2026?</h3>
                <p>
                    Possibly. In 2025, BC received additional nominations
                    mid-year, bringing the total from 4,000 to 6,214. The
                    province is actively negotiating with IRCC for more spots.
                </p>

                <h3>Should I still apply if numbers are low?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes! Competition will be higher, but qualified candidates
                    will still receive invitations. Focus on maximizing your
                    score and targeting priority occupations.
                </p>

                <h3>When will student streams reopen?</h3>
                <p>
                    No timeline has been announced. BC has stated they will not
                    launch new student streams until allocation levels are
                    restored. Monitor official announcements for updates.
                </p>

                <h3>How many draws will there be in 2026?</h3>
                <p>
                    BC PNP typically conducts weekly draws. With 5,254 spots and
                    ~52 weeks, expect approximately 100 invitations per draw on
                    average—though this varies by stream and priority.
