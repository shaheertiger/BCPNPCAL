            Receiving a nomination means B.C. has selected you. Now, you must pass the federal checks (security, medical, etc.) conducted by IRCC (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada).
        </p>

        <h2>1. Apply for Permanent Residence</h2>
        <p>
            How you apply depends on which stream you were nominated under:
        </p>
        
        <div class="grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-6 not-prose my-8">
            <div class="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-2xl border border-slate-200">
                <h3 class="font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">Express Entry BC</h3>
                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-4">
                    You will receive <strong>600 points</strong> added to your CRS score.
                </p>
                <ol class="text-sm space-y-2 list-decimal list-inside">
                    <li>Accept nomination in your IRCC profile.</li>
                    <li>Wait for the next federal draw (usually 2 weeks).</li>
                    <li>Receive ITA and submit online within 60 days.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time:</strong> ~6 months.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
             <div class="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-2xl border border-slate-200">
                <h3 class="font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">Non-Express Entry (Base)</h3>
                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-4">
                    This includes most ELSS, Tech, and regular Skills Immigration nominees.
                </p>
                <ol class="text-sm space-y-2 list-decimal list-inside">
                    <li>Submit application via the <strong>PR Portal</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Upload nomination certificate.</li>
                    <li>Pay fees online.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time:</strong> 12-18 months.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Work Permit Support Letter</h2>
        <p>
            Does your current work permit expire soon? A BC PNP nomination gives you a special benefit: the <strong>Work Permit Support Letter</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This letter allows you to apply for a new, closed work permit without your employer needing an LMIA (Labor Market Impact Assessment). This bridges the gap while you wait for your PR.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You must request this from BC PNP (it is not automatic).</li>
            <li>It is intended for you to keep working for your nominating employer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Conditions of Nomination</h2>
        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-4 my-6 not-prose">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-red-900 text-sm uppercase tracking-wide">Warning: Do not quit your job!</h3>
            <p class="text-red-800 text-sm mt-1">
                Your nomination is conditional on you maintaining the conditions under which you were nominated.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Until you receive your Permanent Residence (COPR), you generally must:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Continue working for the employer who supported your application.</li>
            <li>Maintain your full-time status and wage.</li>
            <li>Reside in British Columbia.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you lose your job or want to switch employers, you <strong>must inform BC PNP immediately</strong>. Failure to do so can lead to your nomination being withdrawn, which cancels your PR application.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Medical and Security Checks</h2>
        <p>
            After you apply for PR, IRCC will ask for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Medical Exam:</strong> You and your family must pass a medical exam by a panel physician.</li>
            <li><strong>Police Certificates:</strong> Required for every country you lived in for 6+ months since age 18.</li>
            <li><strong>Biometrics:</strong> Fingerprints and photo at a Service Canada location.</li>
        </ul>
