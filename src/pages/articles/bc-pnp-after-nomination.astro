                    Receiving a nomination means B.C. has selected you for
                    permanent residence. Now you must pass the federal checks
                    (security, medical, etc.) conducted by IRCC (Immigration,
                    Refugees and Citizenship Canada). Here's your complete
                    roadmap.
                </p>

                <h2>Step 1: Understand Your Nomination Certificate</h2>
                <p>
                    When BC PNP approves your application, you'll receive a <strong
                        >Provincial Nomination Certificate</strong
                    >. This is a PDF document that you'll need for your federal
                    PR application. Key details on the certificate:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Your personal information</strong> (name, date of
                        birth)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Nomination stream</strong> (EEBC or Skills Immigration)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Validity period</strong> (typically valid for 6 months)
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Conditions</strong> of your nomination</li>
                </ul>

                >
                    <strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> Your nomination certificate has
                    an expiry date. You must submit your federal PR application before
                    it expires, or request an extension from BC PNP.

                <p>

                <h3>What It Does</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Allows you to apply for a new work permit without your
                        employer needing an LMIA
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bridges the gap between your current permit and PR
                        approval
                    </li>
                    <li>Lets you continue working legally while waiting</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to Request It</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Log into your BC PNP Online account</li>
                    <li>Navigate to your approved nomination</li>
                    <li>Submit a request for Work Permit Support Letter</li>
                    <li>
                        BC PNP will issue the letter (usually within 1-2 weeks)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use the letter to apply for a new work permit with IRCC
                    </li>
                </ol>

                >
                    <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> Don't wait until your work permit
                    is about to expire. Request the support letter and apply for a
                    new work permit at least 4 months before your current permit expires.

                <h2>Step 5: Maintain Your Nomination Conditions</h2>
                <p>
                    Your nomination is <strong>conditional</strong>. Until you
                    receive your Confirmation of Permanent Residence (COPR), you
                    must maintain the conditions under which you were nominated.
                </p>

                        Leaving your employer before receiving PR can result in
                        your nomination being withdrawn, which cancels your
                        entire PR application.
                    </p>

                    <li>
                        Continue working for the employer who supported your
                        application
                    </li>
                    <li>Maintain your full-time status (30+ hours/week)</li>

                    <li>Live and work in British Columbia</li>
                    <li>Keep your work permit valid</li>

                <h3>What If Your Job Situation Changes?</h3>
                <p>
                    If you lose your job, get laid off, or want to switch
                    employers, you <strong

                <h2>Step 6: After PR Approval (COPR)</h2>
                <p>
                    When IRCC approves your PR application, you'll receive a <strong
                        >Confirmation of Permanent Residence (COPR)</strong
                    >. What happens next depends on where you are:

                <h3>If You're Inside Canada</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your COPR confirms you're a permanent resident</li>
                    <li>
                        You can apply for a PR card (it will be mailed to you)

                    <li>You can now work for any employer in Canada</li>

                    <li>
                        Your COPR includes a single-entry visa to land in Canada

                <h2>Common Questions After Nomination</h2>

                <h3>Can I travel while waiting for PR?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, but be careful. You need a valid work permit to return
                    to Canada. If you're flagging PR at a port of entry, make
                    sure you have supporting documents. Avoid extended absences
                    that might raise questions about your intention to live in
                    BC.
                </p>

                <h3>What if my nomination expires before I submit PR?</h3>
                <p>
                    Contact BC PNP before your nomination expires to request an
                    extension. Extensions are not guaranteed and must be
                    requested with valid reasons.
                </p>

                <h3>Can my family members work and study?</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Spouse:</strong> Can apply for an open work permit based
                    on your valid work permit or nomination.<br />
                    <strong>Children:</strong> Can study in Canada (K-12 is free;
                    post-secondary requires study permit and may have fees).
                </p>

                <h3>How long must I stay in BC after getting PR?</h3>
                <p>
                    While BC PNP expects you to settle in British Columbia, once
                    you're a permanent resident, you technically have mobility
                    rights across Canada. However, moving immediately after
                    receiving PR may affect future applications (e.g.,
                    citizenship) where you'll need to explain your settlement
                    history.
                </p>

                <h3>What's next after becoming a PR?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apply for SIN (Social Insurance Number)</li>
                    <li>Get provincial health coverage (MSP in BC)</li>
                    <li>
                        Start your 1,095-day countdown for citizenship
                        eligibility

                    <li>
                        Consider applying for PR cards for any future dependents
