                    Helping employees get permanent residence benefits your
                    business:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Retain talent:</strong> Employees with PR are more
                        likely to stay long-term
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>No more permit renewals:</strong> PRs don't need work
                        permit extensions
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                        Respond to BC PNP verification requests within stated

                </ul>

                <h3>After Nomination</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Continue employment until employee receives PR (6-18
                        months)
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Common Employer Mistakes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Vague job duties:</strong> Ensure duties match the
                        NOC description precisely
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Below-median wages:</strong> Offering wages too low
                        for the occupation raises red flags
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Incomplete letterhead:</strong> Include full company
                        address and contact information
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Delayed responses:</strong> Not responding to BC PNP
                        verification requests in time
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Terminated employee:</strong> Firing the employee
                        during processing cancels their application
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>Can I support multiple employees?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. There's no limit to how many BC PNP applications you
                    can support, as long as each position is genuine and meets
                    requirements.
                </p>

                <h3>What if the employee changes positions?</h3>
                <p>
                    If the employee changes roles significantly, BC PNP must be
                    notified. Major changes may require a new application.
                </p>

                <h3>Can I charge the employee for my time?</h3>
                <p>
                    No. IRCC and BC PNP prohibit employers from charging workers
                    for immigration-related costs including LMIA fees and
                    administrative time.
                </p>

                <h3>What if I need to lay off the employee?</h3>
                <p>
                    Notify BC PNP immediately. The employee may be able to find
                    a new employer and transfer their application, but this
                    isn't guaranteed.
