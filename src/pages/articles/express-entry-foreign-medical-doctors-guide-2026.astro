                        In February 2026, Canada introduced a <strong>new Express Entry priority category</strong> specifically for foreign medical doctors with Canadian work experience. The key update is that applicants must now have at least <strong>one year of Canadian work experience</strong> to be eligible for these targeted draws.

                <h2 id="new-category">The New 2026 Priority Category</h2>
                <p>
                    Addressing critical shortages in the Canadian healthcare system has been a primary objective for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). In February 2026, IRCC announced significant updates to the Express Entry system, introducing targeted categories to bring in specialized talent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the most notable additions is the new category specifically for <strong>Foreign Medical Doctors with Canadian work experience</strong>. The first historic draw for this specific category took place in February 2026.
                </p>

                <h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility Requirements</h2>
                <p>
                    To be eligible for an Invitation to Apply (ITA) under this specific category, candidates must first be eligible for one of the three main Express Entry programs:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)</li>
                    <li>Canadian Experience Class (CEC)</li>
                    <li>Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Additionally, candidates must meet specific professional criteria related to their medical practice in Canada.
                </p>

                        Critical Update
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-emerald-900 font-medium">
                        The minimum work experience requirement for all renewed occupational categories, including medical doctors, has been increased from six months to <strong>one full year</strong> as of 2026.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2 id="work-experience">The 1-Year Canadian Experience Rule</h2>
                <p>
                    Previously, some targeted draws required only six months of experience in a targeted occupation. Under the new 2026 rules, foreign medical doctors must demonstrate at least <strong>one continuous year (or equivalent part-time) of Canadian work experience</strong> in their profession within the last three years to be eligible for these specific category-based draws.
                </p>

                <h3>Why the Change?</h3>
                <p>
                    The government increased the requirement to ensure better integration and retention of healthcare professionals within the Canadian medical system before granting permanent residency.
                </p>

                <h2 id="how-to-apply">How to Apply</h2>
                <p>
                    The process for applying under this priority category follows the standard Express Entry workflow, but with a focus on highlighting your specific occupation.
                </p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Assess Eligibility:</strong> Ensure you meet the criteria for FSWP or CEC.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gather Documents:</strong> Obtain your Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) (likely from the Medical Council of Canada) and language test results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create Profile:</strong> Create an Express Entry profile. Ensure your primary NOC code accurately reflects your medical profession.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wait for a Draw:</strong> IRCC conducts periodic draws. If a draw targets foreign medical doctors and your Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score is above the cutoff, you will receive an ITA.</li>
                    <li><strong>Submit PR Application:</strong> You will have 60 days to submit your complete application for permanent residency.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2 id="pnp-options">Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) Alternatives</h2>
                <p>
                    While the Express Entry targeted draws are an excellent pathway, they are highly competitive. Foreign medical doctors should also strongly consider Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many provinces have dedicated healthcare streams. For example, the <strong>BC PNP Health Authority Stream</strong> is specifically designed for public health authorities to recruit and retain physicians, specialists, and other health professionals. Securing a provincial nomination adds 600 points to your CRS score, virtually guaranteeing an ITA in a subsequent Express Entry draw.
