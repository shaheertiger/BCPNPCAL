        <h2>What is the ELSS Stream?</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Entry Level and Semi-Skilled (ELSS)</strong> stream is a unique category within the BC Provincial Nominee Program. It is designed for workers in specific industries where B.C. faces labour shortages, even if those jobs are not considered "high skilled" (TEER 4 or 5).
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike other streams, you cannot apply to this stream directly from outside Canada. You generally need to be working in B.C. already.
        </p>
