                <h2>The Basics: Legal Status 101</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Rule #1:</strong> You must always have valid status in
                    Canada.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your work permit expires, you must stop working
                    immediately (unless you have "Maintained Status"). Working
                    without authorization is a federal crime and will result in
                    an instant refusal of your BC PNP application and a
                    potential 1-5 year ban from Canada.

                <h2>Chapter 1: The Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP)</h2>
                <p>
                    The PGWP is the most common permit for international
                    graduates. However, the rules tightened significantly in
                    2025/2026.
                </p>

                <h3>New Eligibility Requirements (2026)</h3>

                        As of late 2024, graduates from public colleges must
                        often graduate in "labour shortage" fields to be
                        eligible for a PGWP, unless they have a Master's degree.
                    </p>

                <h3>The "180-Day Rule"</h3>
                <p>
                    This is where many students fail. You have exactly <strong
                        >180 days</strong
                    > from the day your final marks are issued (NOT your graduation
                    ceremony) to apply for your PGWP.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Day 1:</strong> You get your final transcript/completion
                        letter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Day 1-180:</strong> You can work full-time *if* you
                        have applied for the PGWP.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Day 181:</strong> If you haven't applied, you lose
                        your eligibility forever.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Can I work while waiting for PGWP approval?</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>YES</strong>, but only if:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>You held a valid study permit when you applied.</li>

                    <li>
                        You did not work more than the authorized hours
                        (20h/week) during your studies.

                <h2>Chapter 2: The Spousal Open Work Permit (SOWP)</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a strategic tool. If one partner studies or works in
                    a high-skilled job, the other partner gets an "Open" work
                    permit to work anywhere.
                </p>

                <h3>Eligibility for Spouses of Workers</h3>
                <p>Your spouse is eligible for an SOWP if you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Work in a TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3 occupation.</li>
                    <li>Have a work permit valid for at least 6 months.</li>
                    <li>Reside in Canada.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Eligibility for Spouses of Students</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>WARNING:</strong> As of 2024/2025, spouses of undergraduate
                    students (diploma/bachelors) are generally <strong
                        >NOT</strong
                    > eligible for SOWP anymore. Generally, only spouses of Master's
                    and Doctoral students retain this privilege.

                        <strong>Note for PNP Applicants:</strong> If you are a PNP
                        nominee, your BOWP is usually "Closed" (restricted to your
                        nominating employer)
                        <em>unless</em> your nomination has no employment restrictions
                        (which is rare for BC PNP).
