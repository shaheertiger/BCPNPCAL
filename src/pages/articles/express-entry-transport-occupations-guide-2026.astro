To be eligible for these targeted category-based draws, applicants must now demonstrate at least <strong>one continuous year</strong> (up from six months) of work experience in an eligible transport NOC code within the last three years.

                <h2 id="why-transport">Why Transport Occupations?</h2>
                <p>
                    A robust transportation sector is the backbone of the Canadian economy. Recognizing the chronic shortages of commercial drivers, pilots, and mechanics, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) continues to prioritize transport professionals through category-based selection draws in Express Entry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By targeting these occupations, Canada aims to strengthen supply chains across its vast geography and support the growth of the aviation and logistics industries.
                </p>

                <h2 id="eligible-noc">Eligible NOC Codes</h2>
                <p>
                    To qualify for the Transport Occupations category, your primary work experience must fall under specific National Occupational Classification (NOC) codes. While the exact list is updated periodically by IRCC, historically targeted occupations include (but are not limited to):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>72404:</strong> Aircraft mechanics and aircraft inspectors</li>
                    <li><strong>73300:</strong> Transport truck drivers</li>
                    <li><strong>72604:</strong> Railway traffic controllers and marine traffic regulators</li>
                    <li><strong>72602:</strong> Deck officers, water transport</li>
                    <li><strong>72603:</strong> Engineer officers, water transport</li>
                    <li><strong>72600:</strong> Air pilots, flight engineers and flying instructors</li>
                    <li><strong>72601:</strong> Air traffic controllers and related occupations</li>
                    <li><strong>73301:</strong> Bus drivers, subway operators and other transit operators</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="experience-requirement">The 1-Year Experience Rule</h2>
                <p>
                    A significant change introduced in early 2026 impacts all category-based draws.
                </p>
                
                <div
                    class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-4 my-6 not-prose rounded-r-xl"

                        Updated Requirement
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-blue-900 font-medium">
                        You must now have <strong>at least one year</strong> of continuous full-time (or equivalent part-time) work experience in a single eligible transport occupation within the past three years. This is an increase from the previous six-month requirement.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    This experience can be acquired either inside or outside of Canada, but it must be properly documented through employment records and reference letters detailing your duties.
                </p>

                <h2 id="how-to-apply">How to Apply</h2>
                <p>
                    To be considered for a targeted transport draw, you must follow these steps:
                </p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Check Base Eligibility:</strong> You must be eligible for one of the main Express Entry programs: the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), the Canadian Experience Class (CEC), or the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP). Note that many transport workers (like truck drivers) are eligible under the FSTP or CEC depending on their Canadian experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Language Testing:</strong> Take an approved language test (IELTS, CELPIP, TEF, or TCF) and meet the minimum requirements for your Express Entry program.</li>
                    <li><strong>ECA:</strong> If your education was completed outside Canada, get an Educational Credential Assessment (ECA).</li>
                    <li><strong>Create Your Profile:</strong> Submit your Express Entry profile, ensuring you accurately select your eligible transport NOC code.</li>
                    <li><strong>Receive ITA:</strong> If you are in the pool and IRCC conducts a draw targeting transport occupations with a CRS cutoff lower than your score, you will receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA).</li>
                </ol>

                <h2 id="pnp-options">Provincial Options (PNP)</h2>
                <p>
                    While the federal Express Entry system is powerful, you should not ignore Provincial Nominee Programs. Almost every province in Canada has a high demand for transport workers, particularly long-haul truck drivers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, the <strong>BC PNP Entry Level and Semi-Skilled (ELSS)</strong> stream offers a pathway for workers in specific transport occupations who are currently working in British Columbia. Similarly, provinces like Saskatchewan and Alberta have dedicated pathways for drivers. Securing a provincial nomination can be a strong alternative if your CRS score is not competitive enough for a federal draw.
                </p>
