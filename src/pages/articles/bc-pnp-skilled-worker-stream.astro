        <h2>Who is this stream for?</h2>
        <p>
            The Skilled Worker stream is for individuals who have received a job offer in a skilled occupation (NOC TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3) and have several years of experience in that field. Unlike the International Graduate stream, you do <strong>not</strong> need a recent Canadian degree.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Eligibility Criteria</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Job Offer:</strong> A full-time, indeterminate (permanent) job offer from an eligible B.C. employer.</li>
            <li><strong>Wage:</strong> The wage must meet industry standards for B.C.</li>
            <li><strong>Experience:</strong> Minimum of <strong>2 years of directly related work experience</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Minimum CLB 4 for TEER 2 and 3 occupations. (TEER 0 and 1 technically have no minimum, but CLB 4+ is highly recommended for points).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-2xl border border-purple-100 my-8 not-prose">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-purple-900 text-lg mb-2">What counts as "Directly Related"?</h3>
            <p class="text-purple-800 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This is the #1 reason for refusal. Your 2 years of experience must generally be in the <strong>same NOC code</strong> as the B.C. job offer.
            </p>
            <p class="text-purple-800 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                <em>Exception:</em> Experience in a higher-level position may count. For example, experience as a "Software Engineering Manager" (TEER 0) usually counts for a "Software Engineer" (TEER 1) job offer. But experience as a "Junior Tech Support" may not count for a "Network Engineer" role.

            Because this is the most popular stream, competition can be high. To boost your SIRS score:
        </p>
         <ol>
            <li><strong>Work in B.C.:</strong> Start working on a temporary work permit first to gain "current employment in B.C." points.</li>
            <li><strong>Move Regional:</strong> Job offers outside of Metro Vancouver get huge bonus points.</li>
            <li><strong>Improve English:</strong> Aim for CLB 9 if possible.</li>
