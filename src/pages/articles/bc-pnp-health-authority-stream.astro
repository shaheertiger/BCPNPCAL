        <h2>Why Apply as a Healthcare Professional?</h2>
        <p>
            B.C. has a critical shortage of healthcare workers. As a result, this stream offers some of the most favorable terms in the entire designated program:
        </p>
        <ul class="marker:text-sky-600">
            <li><strong>Low Cut-Off Scores:</strong> Targeted healthcare draws often have cut-offs around 90-100 points, compared to 120+ for general skilled workers.</li>
            <li><strong>Direct Entry:</strong> If working for a public health authority, you may not need the standard "2 years experience" if the authority sponsors you directly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who is Eligible?</h2>
        <p>
            You must have a full-time, indeterminate job offer from a <strong>Public Health Authority</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA)</li>
            <li>Fraser Health</li>
            <li>Vancouver Coastal Health</li>
            <li>Interior Health</li>
            <li>Island Health</li>
            <li>Northern Health</li>
            <li>New Providence Health Care</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <em>Note:</em> Job offers from private clinics usually <strong>do not qualify</strong> for this specific stream unless the clinic is affiliated with a public authority. Private clinic offers typically fall under the standard Skilled Worker stream.
        </p>

        <h2>Eligible Occupations (NOC List)</h2>
        <p>
            Your job must fall under one of the priority health NOCs:

        <h2>Midwives & Physicians in Private Practice</h2>
        <p>
            There is a special exception for Midwives and certain Physicians. Even if not directly employed by a health authority, you can apply if you have a letter of support from:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An established practice group in B.C. (for Midwives).</li>
            <li>A public health authority confirming your privileges (for Physicians).</li>
        </ul>
