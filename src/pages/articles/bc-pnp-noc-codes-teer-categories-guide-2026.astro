      <!-- Introduction -->
      <p>
        Your National Occupational Classification (NOC) code is one of the most critical elements of your BC PNP application. It determines which immigration stream you qualify for, shapes your wage expectations, and influences your overall competitiveness in the candidate pool. Yet choosing the wrong NOC code remains one of the most common reasons applications are refused or delayed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this comprehensive guide, we break down everything you need to know about NOC codes and the TEER category system for BC PNP in 2026. Whether you are a software developer trying to decide between NOC 21232 and 21234, a cook wondering if your role qualifies as TEER 2 or TEER 3, or a newcomer who has never encountered the NOC system before, this guide will walk you through the entire process from identification to application. Use our <a href="/bc-pnp-calculator" class="text-indigo-600 underline font-semibold">BC PNP Points Calculator</a> alongside this guide to see how your occupation and wage translate into a SIRS score.
      </p>

      <!-- Section 1 -->
      <h2 id="what-is-noc" class="text-2xl font-black text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4">1. What Is the NOC and Why Does It Matter for BC PNP?</h2>

      <p>
        The <strong>National Occupational Classification (NOC)</strong> is Canada's standardized system for describing and organizing every occupation in the Canadian labour market. Maintained by Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) and Statistics Canada, the NOC assigns a unique five-digit code to each of over 500 distinct occupational groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        For BC PNP applicants, the NOC code serves multiple purposes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stream eligibility:</strong> Each BC PNP stream restricts which TEER categories (and therefore NOC codes) are eligible. Picking a code outside your stream's accepted TEER levels means automatic ineligibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Wage benchmarking:</strong> BC PNP officers compare your offered wage against the median wage for your NOC in your region. Wages below the median can raise red flags or affect your points.</li>
        <li><strong>Job duties validation:</strong> Officers verify that your actual job duties match the duties listed under your claimed NOC. A mismatch between your reference letter and the NOC description is a leading cause of refusals.</li>
        <li><strong>Priority processing:</strong> Certain NOC codes fall under the <a href="/articles/bc-pnp-tech-stream-occupations" class="text-indigo-600 underline">BC PNP Tech stream</a>, which offers accelerated processing and more frequent draws.</li>
      </ul>

          Your NOC code is not determined by your job title. Two people with the title "Project Manager" might have entirely different NOC codes depending on their actual duties. Always match your duties, not your title.

      <h2 id="teer-explained" class="text-2xl font-black text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4">2. TEER Categories Explained: The 2021 NOC System</h2>

      <p>
        When Canada introduced the 2021 NOC in November 2022, it replaced the old skill-level system (A, B, C, D) with <strong>Training, Education, Experience, and Responsibilities (TEER)</strong> categories numbered 0 through 5. The TEER category is encoded as the second digit of every five-digit NOC code.

      <p>
        The TEER category is the single most important factor in determining your BC PNP stream eligibility. While the old system classified workers as "skilled" (A and B) or "low-skilled" (C and D), the TEER system provides a more nuanced breakdown that better reflects the diverse training pathways in Canada's labour market.

      <h2 id="find-noc" class="text-2xl font-black text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4">4. How to Find Your NOC Code: Step-by-Step</h2>

      <p>
        Finding the correct NOC code requires careful analysis. Follow this process:
      </p>

      <h3>Step 1: Gather Your Job Documentation</h3>
      <p>
        Before searching, compile your job offer letter, employment contract, and any reference letters. The key information you need is your <strong>actual list of daily job duties</strong>, not just your job title.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 2: Search the NOC Database</h3>
      <p>
        Go to the Government of Canada's official NOC website (<strong>noc.esdc.gc.ca</strong>). You can search by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Job title:</strong> Enter your title and browse the results. Be aware that one title can map to multiple NOC codes.</li>
        <li><strong>Keyword:</strong> Search for specific duties or industry terms related to your work.</li>
        <li><strong>NOC code:</strong> If you already have a code, look it up directly to verify it matches your duties.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 3: Compare Lead Statement and Main Duties</h3>
      <p>
        Each NOC page lists a <strong>lead statement</strong> (a one-sentence summary of the role) and a detailed list of <strong>main duties</strong>. You should be performing a <strong>majority</strong> of the listed duties. You do not need to perform every duty listed, but the overall description should reasonably match your actual work.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 4: Check Employment Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        The NOC page also lists typical employment requirements (education, certifications, experience). While these are guidelines rather than strict rules, significant deviation may trigger questions from immigration officers.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 5: Cross-Reference Similar NOCs</h3>
      <p>
        If your search returns multiple potential NOC codes, compare each one carefully. For example, a "Web Developer" might match:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>21234</strong> (Web developers and programmers) — TEER 2</li>
        <li><strong>21232</strong> (Software developers and programmers) — TEER 1</li>

      <p>
        The difference can affect your TEER level, which changes your stream eligibility and wage benchmark. Choose the NOC that most accurately reflects what you do, not the one with the "better" TEER level.

      <p>
        This structure means you can quickly identify the TEER level of any NOC code by looking at the <strong>second digit</strong>. A code starting with "21" is a TEER 1 occupation in the natural and applied sciences category, while a code starting with "63" is a TEER 3 occupation in sales and services.

        The BC PNP Skills Immigration Ranking System (SIRS) does not directly award points based on your NOC code. However, your occupation indirectly affects your score in several important ways:

        For example, a software developer (NOC 21232) earning $55/hour in Vancouver scores differently than a cook (NOC 63200) earning $19/hour in the same city—not because of the NOC itself, but because of the wage differential.

      <p>
        <strong>Why this matters:</strong> The shift from skill levels to TEER categories expanded the definition of "skilled" occupations. Under the old system, skill level B (college diploma or apprenticeship) was the cutoff. Under TEER, the equivalent TEER 3 now also includes occupations that require less than two years of college training or several months of on-the-job training. This means some occupations that were previously "semi-skilled" (old level C) are now classified as TEER 3 and eligible for the Skilled Worker and International Graduate streams.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are referencing old resources or immigration forums that use four-digit NOC codes, you must convert them to the 2021 five-digit equivalents. ESDC provides a concordance table on the NOC website for this purpose.

      <!-- Section 9 -->
      <h2 id="common-mistakes" class="text-2xl font-black text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4">9. Common NOC Code Mistakes That Get Applications Rejected</h2>

      <p>
        Based on common patterns in BC PNP refusals (covered in detail in our <a href="/articles/bc-pnp-common-mistakes" class="text-indigo-600 underline">15 common mistakes guide</a>), here are the most frequent NOC-related errors:
      </p>

      <h3>Mistake 1: Choosing NOC by Title Instead of Duties</h3>
      <p>
        A "Marketing Coordinator" might fall under NOC 11202 (Professional occupations in advertising and marketing) or NOC 12011 (Administrative assistants), depending on actual duties. Immigration officers will compare your reference letter's duty descriptions against the NOC's duty list—not your title.
      </p>

      <h3>Mistake 2: Using the Old 4-Digit NOC Code</h3>
      <p>
        Applications submitted with 2016 NOC codes will be rejected. Always verify you are using the five-digit 2021 NOC code. If your employer's paperwork references old codes, update them before applying.
      </p>

      <h3>Mistake 3: Reference Letter Duties Not Matching the NOC</h3>
      <p>
        Your employer's reference letter must describe duties that align with the NOC you claim. Vague or overly generic descriptions raise red flags. Ask your employer to list specific duties that mirror the NOC's main duties list.
      </p>

      <h3>Mistake 4: Claiming a Higher TEER for a Better Chance</h3>
      <p>
        Inflating your NOC to a higher TEER level (e.g., claiming TEER 1 when your duties are TEER 2) is misrepresentation. BC PNP officers verify duties and can request additional documentation. A misrepresentation finding can bar you from Canadian immigration programs for multiple years.
      </p>

      <h3>Mistake 5: Ignoring the Wage-NOC Relationship</h3>
      <p>
        If your claimed NOC has a median wage of $35/hour in your region but your job offer pays $20/hour, officers may question whether the role truly matches that NOC. Significant wage discrepancies can lead to further scrutiny or refusal. Check the <a href="/articles/bc-pnp-job-offer-requirements-2026" class="text-indigo-600 underline">job offer requirements guide</a> for wage thresholds.
      </p>

      <!-- Section 10: FAQ -->
      <h2 id="faq" class="text-2xl font-black text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4">10. Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>What NOC codes are eligible for BC PNP in 2026?</h3>
      <p>
        Most BC PNP Skills Immigration streams accept TEER 0, 1, 2, and 3 occupations. The Entry Level and Semi-Skilled stream also accepts TEER 4 and 5 in specific industries. The Health Authority stream accepts TEER 0 through 4 for roles within BC public health authorities.
      </p>

      <h3>How do I find my NOC code for BC PNP?</h3>
      <p>
        Visit the Government of Canada's NOC search tool at noc.esdc.gc.ca. Search by your job title or keywords related to your duties. Then compare the listed main duties with your actual daily work. The correct NOC is determined by what you do, not your job title.
      </p>

      <h3>What is the difference between TEER 0 and TEER 1?</h3>
      <p>
        TEER 0 covers management occupations (financial managers, restaurant managers, construction managers). TEER 1 covers professional occupations typically requiring a university degree (software engineers, nurses, accountants). Both qualify for most BC PNP streams.
      </p>

      <h3>Did Canada change the NOC system?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Canada switched from the 2016 NOC (four-digit codes with skill levels A, B, C, D) to the 2021 NOC (five-digit codes with TEER categories 0-5) in November 2022. All 2026 BC PNP applications must use the 2021 codes.
      </p>

      <h3>Does my NOC code affect my BC PNP points score?</h3>
      <p>
        Not directly. The SIRS scoring system does not assign points based on NOC. However, your NOC indirectly affects your score through your wage level (up to 55 points), regional employment location (up to 15 points), and access to priority processing under the Tech stream.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I change my NOC code after registering?</h3>
      <p>
        If your job duties change or you realize you selected the wrong NOC, you should create a new registration profile with the correct NOC code. Do not wait to be invited under the wrong code, as your application will be assessed against the NOC you declare.
      </p>

      <h3>What if my job has duties from two different NOC codes?</h3>
      <p>
        Choose the NOC code that best represents the <strong>majority</strong> of your duties and the primary purpose of your role. If your duties are evenly split, consult with a regulated Canadian immigration consultant (RCIC) before applying.
