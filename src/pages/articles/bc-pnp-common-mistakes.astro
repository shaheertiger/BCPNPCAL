                <h3>1. Wrong NOC Code Selection</h3>
                <div
                    class="bg-red-50 p-5 rounded-xl text-sm border border-red-200 mb-4 not-prose"

                        ❌ The Mistake
                    </div>
                    <p class="text-red-700">
                        Choosing a NOC code based on job title rather than
                        actual duties performed.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Your NOC code must reflect your <strong
                        >actual work duties</strong
                    >, not just your job title. A "Marketing Manager" doing
                    administrative work is not NOC 10011. BC PNP verifies duties
                    during processing by contacting your employer.
                </p>
                <p><strong>How to Fix:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Read the full NOC description on the Government of
                        Canada website
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Match at least 50% of the listed main duties to your
                        actual role
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ask your employer to confirm the correct NOC in your job
                        offer letter
                    </li>
                    <li>When in doubt, consult an immigration professional</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Overstating Your Score</h3>
                <div
                    class="bg-red-50 p-5 rounded-xl text-sm border border-red-200 mb-4 not-prose"

                        ❌ The Mistake
                    </div>
                    <p class="text-red-700">
                        Inflating points for work experience, wage, or education
                        to get a higher SIRS score.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Some applicants claim extra years of work experience or a
                    higher wage than reality. BC PNP cross-references every
                    claim with supporting documents. Misrepresentation, even
                    unintentional, can result in:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Application refusal</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>5-year ban</strong> from BC PNP</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Potential inadmissibility</strong> to Canada
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>How to Fix:</strong> Be honest. It's better to have a
                    lower score than to face a ban. Double-check all information before
                    registering.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Using Expired Language Test Results</h3>

                    > from the test date. If your test expires during BC PNP processing
                    or before you submit your federal PR application, you may be refused.
                </p>
                <p><strong>How to Fix:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Check that your test will be valid for at least 8-12
                        months from registration
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Plan to retake the test if it will expire during the
                        expected processing time

                    <li>Book a new test early—slots fill up quickly</li>

                <h3>4. Not Updating Your Profile</h3>

                    If your job, wage, employer, or language scores change while

                        >must update your registration</strong
                    >. An outdated profile leads to rejection when your

                    ask. It's always better to clarify with BC PNP or consult an immigration
                    professional than to guess and risk your entire immigration future.

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>What happens if I made an honest mistake?</h3>
                <p>
                    Contact BC PNP immediately to correct the error. Honest
                    mistakes caught early are usually fixable. Hiding errors or
                    making false statements is the problem.
                </p>

                <h3>Can I reapply if my application was refused?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, in most cases. However, if you were refused for
                    misrepresentation, you may face a 5-year ban.
                </p>

                <h3>How do I know if my employer is eligible?</h3>
                <p>
                    Check the BC PNP Program Guide or contact BC PNP directly.
                    You can also verify the company's status with BC Registries.
