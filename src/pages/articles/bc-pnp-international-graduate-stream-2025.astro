            Starting January 2025, the previous "International Graduate" and "International Post-Graduate" streams have been replaced. The new system is designed to provide clearer pathways based on your level of education: Bachelor's, Master's, or Doctorate.

            <p class="font-bold text-yellow-800 text-sm uppercase tracking-wide mb-1">Crucial Update</p>
            <p class="text-yellow-900 font-medium">All graduate streams now require a minimum language score of <strong>CLB 8</strong>. This is a significant increase from previous years.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. The Bachelor's Stream</h2>
        <p>
            Designed for recent graduates who have completed an undergraduate degree from an eligible post-secondary institution in British Columbia within the last three years.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Education:</strong> Bachelor's degree from an eligible B.C. institution.</li>
            <li><strong>Job Offer Required:</strong> Yes. You must have a full-time, <strong>indeterminate</strong> (permanent) job offer.</li>
            <li><strong>Eligible Jobs:</strong> Any occupation in NOC TEER 1, 2, or 3. There is <em>no specific field of study requirement</em> for the degree itself.</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Minimum CLB 8.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. The Master's Stream</h2>
        <p>
            For graduates with a Master's degree from an eligible B.C. institution. This replaces the old science-focused IPG stream but is now open to <strong>any field of study</strong>.
        </p>
        <ul>
             <li><strong>Education:</strong> Master's degree from an eligible B.C. institution.</li>
            <li><strong>Job Offer Required:</strong> Yes. However, unlike the Bachelor's stream, this offer must be for a minimum of <strong>one year</strong> (does not strictly need to be indeterminate).</li>
            <li><strong>Eligible Jobs:</strong> NOC TEER 1, 2, or 3.</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Minimum CLB 8.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. The Doctorate Stream</h2>
        <p>
            The premier pathway for researchers and advanced scholars. This stream recognizes the high value of doctoral candidates to the B.C. economy.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Education:</strong> Ph.D. from an eligible B.C. institution (graduated or advanced to candidacy).</li>
            <li><strong>Job Offer Required:</strong> <strong>NO.</strong> This is the only stream where no job offer is required to apply.</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Minimum CLB 8.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        <h3>What if I have a Diploma?</h3>
        <p>
            Graduates with a Diploma or Certificate are generally <strong>not eligible</strong> for these three specific streams. You would instead apply under the <strong>Skilled Worker</strong> or <strong>Entry Level and Semi-Skilled</strong> streams, provided you qualify.
        </p>

        <h3>What happened to the BC PNP IPG (International Post-Graduate)?</h3>
        <p>
            The old BC PNP International Post-Graduate (IPG) stream, which was limited to science, health, and engineering fields, has been effectively expanded into the new Master's and Doctorate streams. Now, graduates from <em>any</em> field (Arts, Business, etc.) can qualify, provided they (for Master's) secure a relevant job offer.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the BC PNP International Graduate eligibility requirements?</h3>
        <p>
            To be eligible for any of the three BC PNP international graduate streams, you must:

        <ul>
            <li>Have graduated from an eligible B.C. post-secondary institution within the last 3 years</li>
            <li>Meet the minimum language requirement of CLB 8</li>
            <li>Have a qualifying job offer (except Doctorate stream)</li>
            <li>Show you can support yourself financially in B.C.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Eligible BC Institutions</h2>
        <p>
            Your degree must be from a public post-secondary institution in British Columbia, such as:

        <ul>
            <li>University of British Columbia (UBC)</li>
            <li>Simon Fraser University (SFU)</li>
